# Create Expo Stack CLI

<a href="https://badge.fury.io/js/create-expo-stack"><img src="https://badge.fury.io/js/create-expo-stack.svg" alt="npm version" height="18"></a>

## Description

This CLI tool is designed to help you get started with React Native and Expo as quickly as possible. The CLI options allow you to configure your project with Typescript, file-based routing with Expo Router, pure React-Navigation, and/or Tailwind CSS with NativeWind. Roadmap coming soon...

## Usage

To get started, use npx to run the CLI tool. You will be prompted to opt into the features you want to use.

`npx create-expo-stack@latest`

## Tech Stack for the templates

Currently, all of the [templates](https://github.com/danstepanov/create-expo-stack) use the same versions of the following libraries. Not all of the templates include all of the libraries, but they are all available for use.

The templates themselves are located in the branches of this repository. You can explore them by toggling the branch dropdown above. You are welcome to use these templates directly, but it is recommended to use the CLI tool instead.
